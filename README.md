# TagUtil
Music file utility, mainly created because I want to rename directories based on content. 
It can rename the current directory based on content and is able to give a label if files are missing or corrupt
or there is a mismatch on bitrates.

### Prerequisites
You need my adapted version of Taglib-Sharp
