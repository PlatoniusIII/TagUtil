# TagUtil
Music file utility, mainly created because I want to rename directories based on content. 
In the hopefully not-so-distant-future it can rename the current directory based on content and is able to give a label if files are missing or corrupt or there is a mismatch on bitrates.

It's also my play pen for trying to decode the Serato tags and figuring out why my Sony walkman doesn't want to display cover art for some files.

### Prerequisites
You need my adapted version of Taglib-Sharp
